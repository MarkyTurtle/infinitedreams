PRO-PACK UNPACK Prototype
-------------------------

Function
--------

To unpack a PRO-PACK packed file

Syntax
------

extern long near UNPACK(void far *input, void far *output)

OR

extern long near UNPACK(void far *input, void far *output, word key)

On entry
--------

*input is the address of the packed file and *output is the address the
file gets unpacked to. If the packed file has been protected with a key
then the same key must be used to unpack the file.

On exit
-------

On successful completion UNPACK returns the length in bytes of the unpacked
file. Otherwise it returns an error code

 0 = on entry *input does not point to a packed file
-1 = packed data CRC error
-2 = unpacked data CRC error

Note:
-----

The packed file can be unpacked 'over itself' by making *output equal to
*input. If this is the case the last 32 bytes of memory after the end of
the unpacked file will be corrupted.
