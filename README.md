# The Lunatics UK - Infinite Dreams - Music Disks

![InfiniteDreams](/images/InfiniteDreamsScreen.png)

A demo that I wrote in 1992, the last one I did for 'The Lunatics UK', just before I went off to University and stopped writting anymore demos. It's quite sad looking back that I didn't continue developing on the Amiga.

I'll have to disassemble the code because the source has long gone into the great dustbin in the sky.

## Production Credits
Code: Spongehead (myself :-) )
Graphics: JOE, TSM
Music: Hollywood, Subculture(Subi), Phaser, Reeal

Maybe I'll this will trigger me do develop something new after this project...

## Progress To Date
**2025-05-07** - Completed Disassembly of the bootblock Disk 1
**2025-05-06** - Started Disassembling the bootblock of Disk 1
