# The Lunatics - Infinite Dreams - Music Disks

![Batman the Movie](/images/InfiniteDreamsScreen.png)

A demo that I wrote in 1992, the last one I did for 'The Lunatics UK', just before I went off to University and stopped writting anymore demos. It's quite sad looking back that I didn't continue developing on the Amiga.

I'll have to disassemble the code because the source has long gone into the great dustbin in the sky.

Maybe I'll this will trigger me do develop something new after this project...
