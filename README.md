# The Lunatics UK - Infinite Dreams - Music Disks

![InfiniteDreams](/images/InfiniteDreamsScreen.png)

A demo that I wrote in 1992, the last one I did for 'The Lunatics UK', just before I went off to University and stopped writting anymore demos. It's quite sad looking back that I didn't continue developing on the Amiga.

I'll have to disassemble the code because the source has long gone into the great dustbin in the sky.

## Production Credits
Code: **Spongehead**<br/>
Graphics: **JOE, T.S.M**<br/>
Music: **Hollywood, Subculture(Subi), Phaser, Reeal**<br/>

Maybe I'll this will trigger me do develop something new after this project...

## Progress To Date
- **2025-05-25** - Mostly documented the disassembly of the demo code. Just the line draw routine and music player left to document. (I think the music player was supplied by someone else originally).  Think I might try to fit a new disk loader to this and see hoe much I can compress onto a single disk using modern compaction tools. I'll have a think...
- **2025-05-24** - Demo runs from VSCode, all components are working. Can load music from the original disks. I have just begun ripping the protracker modules from the original disks.
- **2025-05-12** - Demo is Disassembled and can be run inside VSCode. Not all working yet, The main logo and scroller is working. 
- **2025-05-07** - Completed Disassembly of the bootblock Disk 1
- **2025-05-06** - Started Disassembling the bootblock of Disk 1
