@node "What is Speedy Gonzales?" "What is Speedy Gonzales?"
Speedy Gonzales is yet another ripper. The reason I continued developing
it, was that there are so many BAD coded rippers nowadays. I think
Speedy Gonzales is the only ripper that supports redirected I/O and may
be started from WorkBench! Besides these features, SG is small and uses
NO chip-memory if your Amiga is equipped with fast-ram. (Other rippers
opens that friggin' window...) Besides, Speedy Gonzales is pretty fast,
test yourself!

Speedy Gonzales is capable of ripping the following moduleformats:

    Laxity Tracker
    NoiseTracker V1.0 - 2.2 (Not 1.3d packed)
    Phenomena Packer V1.0
    ProPacker V2.0 - 2.1
    ProRunner V1.0 - 2.0
    ProRunner V2.0 preprocessed
    ProTracker V1.0 - 3.15
    ProTracker V2.1 - 2.3 (100-Pattern modules)
    QuadraComposer V1.3 - 2.1 (Also called EMOD modules)
    SoundTracker V2.3 - 2.5
    StartTrekker V1.0 - 1.3 (Not AM sounds nor 8 channels)
    UNIC Tracker
    Wanton Packer

...and also all formats 100% compatible with the formats listed. It will
also search through your entire chipmem _AND_ fastmem. No trouble with 1
MB chip, or even virtual memory!
@endnode

@node "Why use Speedy Gonzales?" "Why use Speedy Gonzales?"
* SG Uppercases the first letter in the modulename.

* MANY shortcuts. You'll never again have to search 10 times before you
find out what I've named the command you need.

* Intelligent modulesave, which creates the modulename on it's own. No
more mistypes on a keymap you never use unless you're ripping. (Unless
you're american/english, that is.)

* WShell/Kickstart 2.0/KingCON closegadget works fine.

* Versionstring for the 2.0 Version-command.

* Uses CLI/SHELL-window instead of own window to save precious chip-mem
from being over-written. (In fact, no other rippers preserves as much
chip-memory as SG!)

* The only ripper that allows you to use allocated memory instead of
absolute addresses when reading binary files.

* Works 100% in NTSC.

* Speedy Gonzales is 100 % pure, and may be made resident.

* Automatically finds and utilises extra chip-memory. No more
time-wasting extra-commands or arguments.

* SG is written 100% in assembler, to make all operations work as fast
as possible, only for the users' comfort.

* The only ripper available which supports redirectable I/O.

* May be started with user-defined window.

* The only ripper that supports virtual memory!

* Searches fast-memory. (Some games use fast-memory to save chipmem and
make their 8-voice routines work faster!) And you may also find modules
after a crash with ProTracker!

* No other rippers displays as much info on the modules as SG.

* @{"Number input" link "Numeric input" 0} supports signs, octal, decimal, hexadecimal and binary
numbers.

* SG checks if file exists before overwriting.

* SG is launchable from Workbench.

* SG decrunches files using xfdmaster-library, which supports at current
113 crunchers, including xpk-library.

* SG does not crash when encountering long argument strings as a lot of
programs do. SG supports 160 bytes long strings, and will respond with
correct errormessages when the string exceeds this limit.

* SG utilises kickstart 2.0+ to present you with meaningful
errormessages when something goes wrong.

* SG allocates the found modules to prevent them from being
overwritten.

* SG is developed using official Commodore debugging tools such as
Enforcer and Mungwall and should therefore be considered fairly
bugfree.

* SG flushes the caches after decrunching, so it should work perfectly
well on mutated Amigas. 8)

@node "Requirements" "Requirements"
None at all. Speedy Gonzales should work on all Amiga configurations
from an Amiga 1000 with 256 Kb chipmemory to an A4000/040 with 2 meg
chipmemory and 128 gigabyte virtual fastmemory and AGSGDY chipset...

However, to fully make use of the sophisticated decrunch engine of
Speedy  Gonzales, it is adviced to install the xfd decrunch package.
This is freely  distributable and available a bunch of places. ;)
@endnode

@node "Commands available" "Commands available"
@{b}ABOUT@{ub} - Equivalents : None.

Displays some rather uninteresting information.



@{b}CONTINUE@{ub} - Equivalents : 'CONT', 'C'

Continues search from current module. If there is no current module, the
search will be processed as the 'HUNT' command. If no module is found,
the current module will remain current.



@{b}CD@{ub} [DIRECTORY] - Equivalents : None.

Changes the current directory. If typed without a parameter, you will be
informed of the current directory.



@{b}DIRECTORY@{ub} [DIRECTORY] - Equivalents : 'DIR'

Shows the name of the device/assign, all its selected contents and bytes
free. [DIRECTORY] may be a device, volume, assign, directory or file.



@{b}DUMP@{ub} [LF|ADR] [H|A|HF|AF] [OFFSET] - Equivalents : 'D'

Dumps the contents of the selected address and outwards. H-mode gives
hex dump, while A gives ASCII output. By appending an F to the mode, an
extended range of ASCII characters will be printed. Pause the dump with
right mousebutton and break with Ctrl-C.



@{b}FDISK@{ub} [UNIT] [STARTSEC] [NUMSEC] - Equivalents : 'FD'

Reads the selected sectors from a trackdisk unit and chains the memory
to the filelist as "Read disk". The default numbers are 0, 0 and 1760.



@{b}FFLUSH@{ub} [FILE] - Equivalents : 'FF'

Flushes the selected file from memory. If no file is selected, all files
are flushed.



@{b}FLIST@{ub} - Equivalents : 'FL'

Lists all files currently in the filelist.



@{b}FLUSH@{ub} - Equivalents : None.

Closes all disk-based libraries opened by SG, and flushes all unused
system resources from memory.



@{b}FREAD@{ub} [FILE] - Equivalents : 'FR'

Loads the file attempting the use of xfdmaster-library and then chains
it to the filelist. The files location may be found by using FLIST, and
may be flushed with FFLUSH.



@{b}HUNT@{ub} [LF|ADDRESS] - Equivalents : 'H', 'SEARCH'

Hunt will start searching your entire memory for modules either from the
specified address, from the start of your chipmemory or from the
startaddress of a file in the filelist. All chipmemory is first
searched, then your fastmem. If no address is given, SG will search from
the first fairly large chunk of free memory.



@{b}INFORMATION@{ub} - Equivalents : 'I', 'INFO'

Information will show all information relevant to the current module,
including the 31 first instruments.



@{b}MENU@{ub} - Equivalents : 'HELP', '?'

Will show a list of all commands available. Useful?



@{b}QUIT@{ub} - Equivalents : 'Q', 'X', 'EXIT', '!'

Will exit SG. No further documentation necessary.



@{b}READBIN@{ub} [NAME] [ADR] [LEN] - Equivalents : 'RB', 'READB'

Will attempt to read [LEN] bytes from the file [NAME] to address [ADR].
If [LEN] is omitted, the entire file will be loaded. All errors will be
reported.



@{b}SAVE@{ub} [FILENAME/PATH] - Equivalents : 'S', 'W', 'WRITE'

Will attempt to save the current module. By omitting path, the module
will be saved in current directory. If no filename is specified, SG will
attempt to create one for you. If this couldn't be done, you will be
notified.



@{b}SEARCH@{ub} [LF|ADR] [LF|LEN] [D|T] [D1-D4] - Equivalents : 'FIND'

Search a specified range of your memory for a given string or data. The
'D' specifies datamode, where D1-D4 specifies bytes to search for (you
don't need to specify all). While a 'T' specifies textmode, where a
string is searched for. The string does not have to be zero-terminated.
        Ex:     SEARCH $40000 10240 D $F3 $46 %10110100
        ...or:  SEARCH GAME.DAT GAME.DAT T "PP20"



@{b}WRITEBIN@{ub} [NAME] [LF|ADR] [LF|LEN] - Equivalents : 'WB', 'WRITEB'

Will attempt to save the memory from address [ADR] and [LEN] bytes
outwards as [NAME]. Both [ADR] and [LEN] may be specified as the name of
a loaded file. All errors will be reported.
@endnode

@node "List-based file-handling" "List-based file-handling"
This is a new idea, which means that SG keeps track of all loaded files!
The user may load files, flush a file from memory, flush all files or
just list all files with their addresses and sizes.

Some commands (like HUNT) supports the name of a file in the filelist
instead of the start address when searching. If you for instance type
"HUNT C:ED", SG will start searching from the start of the file C:ED and
outwards.

If you're ripping from a pack, you may often encounter files named "1",
"2" and so on. To make SG understand that you are refering to files
instead of memory locations, type the filenames with a leading
backslash. I.e: "hunt \1".
@endnode

@node "Numeric input" "Numeric input"
The numeric input recognised by Speedy Gonzales looks much like the one
used by most assemblers. Here it is:

                           [S][T][DIGS]

[S] - Sign. Either '-' for negative or nothing for positive. Please note
that '+' is _NOT_ accepted.

[T] - Type. '#' or nothing for decimal, '$' for hexadecimal, '%' for
binary and '@' for octal.

[DIGS] - Digits. Depending on type. Max number of digits are 9 for
decimal, 8 for hexadecimal, 32 for binary and 10 for octal.

If any numeric input fails syntax check, a brief overview of this
chapter will be displayed to the user.
@endnode

@node "DOS Template" "DOS Template"
Speedy Gonzales recognises three arguments from CLI. These are:

@{b}IOSTREAM@{ub} - Defines the custom IOSTREAM. For instance "AUX:" will cause
SG to collect all its input and output to and from a remote terminal.
This could also be used to specify a customised window. Ex :
"CON:0/0/642/256/MyWindow" would open a window at coordinates 0,0 with
dimensions 640x256 and title "MyWindow". Please note that this I/O
stream is only used if the default I/O stream couldn't be opened or the
NOSTDIO keyword was issued.

@{b}NOSTDIO@{ub} - This is a single keyword, which causes SG to open it's own
custom I/O stream for input and output. If IOSTREAM isn't defined, this
will cause SG to open a normal console-window with the dimensions
640x200.

@{b}SAFE@{ub} - Prevents SG from doing a round-off on the addresses of your
memory-chunks. Use this if SG crashes on your Amiga.

@{b}?@{ub} - This will cause SG to display a brief summary of this chapter.

SG does also support normal DOS redirection conventions. E.g "SG >AUX:
<CON:0/0/640/100/Input" will cause SG to get it's input from a custom
opened window, and all output written to a remote terminal.

Warning! The IOSTREAM argument does _NOT_ follow the ordinary DOS
argument parser conventions. "SG IOSTREAM 'AUX:'" is legal, but "SG
IOSTREAM='AUX:'" is _NOT_ understood by SG!
@endnode

@node "Converting modules" "Converting modules"
Ripped modules may be converted using Perverter by Kiwi of Effect or
Pro-Wizard by Gryzor. These tools and their documentation is shipped
with Speedy Gonzales. Still, I take no responsibility for the
functionality or distribution of their tools. Read the documentation for
these converters before using them.

@{b}V0.8 - Unknown releasedate.@{ub}
        Sourcesize : Unknown. Objectsize : Unknown.

This was a strange ripper made for my own purposes only. It was
bootblock installable, and was absolutely automatic. It found a module,
copied it to a hardcoded fast-address and continued normal boot
procedure. Thereafter I would load ASM-One and rip it by hand!

* Ripped normal ProTracker modules.

* Based on NSearch V1.0 by Lasse "ALIEN" Magnussen, but I doubled the
speed of the search-routine.

                                ---

@{b}V1.0 - Released 28th of May 1992.@{ub}
        Sourcesize : Unknown. Objectsize : Unknown.

Initial release. The user-interface was developed. (Wow!) This version
weren't spread at all. I just released it to a couple of friends of
mine, which didn't send it further. (Thanks, guys!)

* Recoded from V0.8.

* Added StarTrekker modules.

* SAVE, PLAY, STOP, INFO, QUIT, MENU, HUNT & CONTINUE were included.

* Uppercased first letter in modulename.

* Displayed location of ripper.

* Added filecomment to modules saved by SG.

                                ---

@{b}V1.1 - Released 3rd of June 1992.@{ub}
        Sourcesize : about 20 kb. Objectsize : 17 kb.

This version were the first one which reached to the public. I even got
some feedback... (Hi Pontus! :-) (I really called this one 1.1a, but I
decided to remove those stupid letters...)

* Converted StartTrekker-modules to ProTracker.

* New input-handler (Lasse Magnussen).

* More shortcuts.

* Added ProPacker modules.

* WShell closegadget gurued. Fixed it. This also causes the closegadgets
granted by Kickstart 2.0+ and KingCON to work.

* Bugged if you saved to a clean device (df0:). Fixed. (I still don't
know why this bug got released? Hmm...)

* The filecomment on modules saved by SG never worked. I think it also
destroyed the file sometimes. Fixed.

* Speeded up all textouput. (Wrote one char at a time in V1.0!)

* Added commands LED and ABOUT.

* Instr $20 showed crap. Removed it.

* Didn't stop loops when stopped module. Fixed. (Tech: I didn't reset
the audio-registers.)

* Versionstring for the 2.0 Version-command.

* All shortcuts were underlined in the menu.

                                ---

@{b}V1.19 - Finished 4th of December 1993.@{ub}
        Sourcesize : 26 kb. Objectsize : 22 kb.

Now, SG is about to raise among the wellknown rippers. (In quality, not
fame... :( ) I became a bit depressed when I saw Jack The Ripper and
Exotic Ripper, but decided to continue developing anyway. (No hard
feelings! :-) This version wasn't really released, but since I started
to recode SG the 4th of December and I wanted to show you which source
the changes were done in, I split the history info.

* Removed flashing while searching. Saved 20% time. (Now SG uses 3.8
seconds on 512 kb chip!)

* Displayed filename and length when saving. (Multiripper look-a-like.)

* Removed underlined shortcuts in menu. It was ugly! :-(

* Added DIR command.

* Added ProTracker 100-pattern modules.

* Uses CLI/SHELL-window instead of own window to save precious chip-mem
from being over-written. This will in theory also cause SG to work well
in NTSC. (Give me some feedback on that one, will ya?) I thought of
altering the windowtitle, but couldn't get it to work on kickstart 2.0!

* Added use of BSS-hunk to make the ripper shorter.

* Fixed bug in interrupt, which gurued sometimes. (Thanks to Sveinar
"Archie" Rasmussen for making me aware of this bug, and to Lasse "Alien"
Magnussen for finding it!)(Don't I do anything myself?)

* Fixed nasty bug which caused SG to search 10 bytes _behind_ end of
chipmem. (Crashed on A4000!) (When I fixed the bug, I made the A4000 do
a hardreset instead.:( Refixed.)

* Added mindblasting argumentreader wich supports both '"' and "'".
Arguments are much easier now. All directory-related commands with no
directory given will work in the current directory.

* Added real "cool" about-screen with animation. Afterall, it's just
fast-mem. (To everyone without extra mem: I'm really sorry, but I was
SOOOO tired of the about-screen!(Besides, I wanted to test DIED:-)!)

                                ---

@{b}V1.2 - Released at 30th of March 1994.@{ub}
        Sourcesize : 83 kb. Objectsize : 17 kb.

SG suddenly shrunk drastically in size. Talk about recode! Source is
gettin' huge! :-( Got even more depressed when I received Exotic Ripper
V2.21... Fuck! I had to work like hell to get this sucker finished for
The Gathering '94! Due to this, there will be several bugs... :(

* Totally recoded in an attempt to remove a bug which caused SG to crash
when run on machines with kick 2.0+ and/or 1+ meg chipram. (As you
probably understand, I'm not 100% sure about the conditions this bug
would occur under...)

* Removed all writes inside program segments. This means that SG is
pure, and may be made resident. (Exchanged BSS-hunk with selfallocated
data-area.)

* Code became more bugproof. (Better exit-routines)

* Improved text-output. (Again?) My internal output-commands requires
less arguments, and a Printf() function were included, so SG should
become smaller...

* Earlier versions collected inputhandle in an illegal way. If you
started SG with "SG <AUX:" to make SG collect input from a remote
terminal but still write output to the doswindow, it simply wouldn't
work. I'm not sure if it crashed, but it's more legal now.

* If SG is started with input from PRT: or some other not-working
texthandlers, it will open its own window.

* Went back to simple about-screen.

* Menu and about-pages rewritten.

* Added CLIARG "NOSTDIO" to force SG to open it's own IOStream. If
window couldn't be opened, SG will attempt to use stdout. The same goes
for input.

* Added CLIARG "IOSTREAM" to set the current IO stream.

* HUNT will now also search through fast-memory. As a rule, all memory
is searched through; first all chip, then all other memory.

* Removed PLAY, STOP and LED. Rip modules, convert them and use a
player!

* Bug in my argument-parser caused SG to process only the first argument
when run with several arguments. Fixed.

* Readded output of location of ripper. Outputs _all_ memory taken by
SG, except from eventual windows opened.

* Added number of instruments on module-info. Some modules, eg. Promizer
1.8 and NoisePacker 3.0 (I think) hasn't an absolute number of
instruments. If the module contains more than 31 instruments, SG will
only print information for the first 31...

* Also added repeat-indicator and finetune for the samples on
moduleinfo. This makes SG the ripper with most information on ripped
modules! :-)

* Added CLIARG "?" for a list of cli-arguments available and their
purposes.

* Some people seems to make great fun out of inserting strange ASCII
control functions in their instrument-names, to make rippers go bananas!
It really did on SG, fixed... :-( I also fix the modulenames, just to be
sure.

* Added possibility to abort hunting with Ctrl-C. Continue after abort
will continue from the location SG was aborted.

* Added number-translator. Supports decimal, hexadecimal, binary, octal
and signed numbers!

* Added address argument for HUNT.

* SAVE much improved. Filename creation is more intelligent than ever,
and SG checks if the file exists before overwriting it.

* Help is now available on all commands. Type "[COMMAND] ?" to display.

* Added address notifier while hunting. The address will be updated each
16th kilobyte.

* Added WRITEBIN command for writing memory to disk.

* Disables multitasking while accessing the system memory lists, to
prevent crashes in later versions of the OS.

* Added WB-startup! For the first time in history, SG wont crash when
run from WB with icon... :)

* Added IntelliSearch, which finds 31 Instrument Tracker-modules even if
the ID has been removed!

* Added ProRunner I, Phenomena Packer, UNIC, QuadraComposer and Wanton
Packer modules.

* Added possibility to break directory-reading via Ctrl-C.

* SG does no longer automatically convert StarTrekker and others to
ProTracker.

* Rewrote documentation.

* SG will now handle modules with samples larger than 65535 bytes
correct. (Yes, this is possible on ProTracker 3.10+ and NewTracker!)

* The info Christian Estrup sent me for the ProPacker modules was
incorrect! The only thing that made SG work with these modules earlier,
was that the size-calc routine was a modified extract from the
play-routine...!

* Smarter search on ProPacker modules. Now really searches for the
modules instead of searching for playroutine, as earlier.

* Added FREAD, FLIST and FFLUSH for list-based file handling. (Read
doc!) All files are loaded via decrunch-library (61 executable file
crunchers recognised!!!) and xpk-library (unlimited data file crunchers
supported!!!) if available. The libraries are not opened before they are
needed.

* Added flush-command for flushing all disk-based libraries opened by
SG.

* Added possibility to write the name of a loaded file as an address,
and the address of the file will automagically be used! Size inputs work
the same way, but uses the size of the file instead... For filenames
which looks like a legal number input, insert a '\' before the
filename.

* Added READBIN command with length argument. By omitting this, the
entire file will be read.

                                ---

@{b}V1.3 - Released 1st of January 1996.@{ub}
        Sourcesize : 120 kb.        Objectsize : 24 kb.

Aaaargh! Due to a bug in Trash'Em-One, the entire source got
overwritten!!! (I have switched to ASM-One by TFA now...) Some of the
source was left in memory, but some of it had to be rewritten. Bugs may
appear due to this... :( This gave me a lot of work... The source is
big, but tidy. (: Found a lot of bugs, I don't think there should be
more left...

* Discovered a bug which caused SG to crash if run in EXTREME low-memory
situations. (~1000 bytes couldn't be allocated) Fixed.

* Found a bug in xpk-librarys memory-handling. Xpk decompression
temporarily removed. (Other programs seems to encounter no problems on
this, but I'm sure I haven't done anything wrong?)

* SG now rounds off the locations of your memory, so it will search from
address 0 instead of $420. This may be turned off with cliarg "SAFE" if
your computer crashes. (Don't understand why Lasse Magnussen wanted
this? Those first bytes are overwritten anyway?) :-O

* Nasty bug caused SG to crash (or lock up on 68020+) when hunt was
issued with an odd address. Fixed.

* Expanded maximum size of one argument from 64 to 160 chars, to achieve
longer paths when saving. (I bought a hard-drive!)

* Added check for too long command lines. Argument parser should be
bullet proof now. No guarantees, though. :)

* On devices with blocksize or number of blocks larger than 65535, SG
would come up with far too few bytes free on unit. This fix may cause a
short pause right before this number is printed, but at least it works
now!

* FREAD and READBIN without a filename would cause the reply "Can't read
directories!"? Fixed. (This was actually a side-effect of SG attempting
to read current directory!)

* WRITEBIN without address and/or size would save 0 bytes from address
0. Fixed.

* READBIN without an address would load file at address 0. =:( Fixed.

* When run on kickstart 2.0 or higher, SG will print error-texts instead
of DOS error-codes when something goes wrong during file I/O. (The
side-effect is that no matter what goes wrong, 1.3-users are stuck with
some stupid error- code... SG V1.2 had some texts like "file/dir not
found". Well... Time to upgrade!)

* In previously versions of SG, all input was lowercased. This meant
that you couldn't save files with uppercased letters in their names.
This is now fixed. This also implies all entries in memory-list to be
stored with correct case.

* Writebin and save module issued with a directory as filename would
result in "File already exists! Overwrite?". Will now respond with
"object already exists". (On kick 2.0+ only!)

* UNIC/Laxity-tracker are both Laxity's mutations of the
ProTrackerformat. Updated documentation.

* Added ProRunner V2.0 processed modules.

* Added internal decrunch of RNC (Rob Northern Compressed) version 1
packed datafiles and executable files. These files may be found in a lot
of games, such as Bubba&Stix, PushOver, CannonFodder 1 & 2 and Lemmings
II. Thanks to Lasse Magnussen (again) for disassembling the loader for
Lemmings II.

* Added CD (current directory) command. Nice when decrunching a lot of
files from a directory. (No directory displays the current directory.)

* Added fairly advanced dump-function. (HEX, ASCII, ASCIIONLY, offset,
loaded files, etc.)

* The memory of the current module will be allocated and inserted in the
memory-list with the modulename or "Found module" if module-format
doesn't support name. No notification is done if this fails.

* If hunt is specified without any address, SG will start hunting from
the first fairly large chunk of free memory. This means that all memory
already in use will be skipped.

* Added SEARCH command with data (1 through 4 bytes) and text-mode
(string).

* Added FDISK command which allows sectors from a trackdisk unit to be
read and added to filelist. Unfortunately this command will read the
disk to chip when run under kickstarts below 2.0.

* Discovered the big truth concerning ProRunner modules. Updated
documentation.

* Files with sizes larger than 999,999 bytes would sort of garble the
directory-listing. Should not occur before filesizes of 100,000,000
bytes now.

* QuadraComposer modules with more than 31 instruments would cause SG to
crash or atleast fuck up real bad. Fixed now.

* Optimized search-routines.

* Bought myself a '030 card with an MMU. SG is now developed using
Enforcer and Mungwall (official ex. Commodore debugging tools), and
should be clinically free from hits of both kinds.

* SG now finally signals correctly which parts of its allocated memory
that may be paged (virtual).

* Added RNC version 2 crunched datafiles to the decruncher.

* Scratched decrunch-library in favor of xfdmaster-library (also written
by Georg Hörmann!). (This also implies a poor but adequate
xpk-support.)

* Improved the decrunch-routines. Should now be more stable and slightly
faster.

* None of the internal decrunchroutines cleared any caches after
decrunching. This is now done in a proper way.

* If you ask SG to search within a loaded file, only the file will be
searched, and not the rest of the memory as earlier. Breaking this
search and issuing CONTINUE will search through rest of mem though.

* Made the HUNT command also output the actual range searched.

* SG now sets console-modes when writing to its output. This may (or may
not) cause nicer behaviour when run on external terminals.

* Removed 'HELP' as shortcut for menu, since I'll probably implement an
AmigaGuide®-function later.

@{b}NORMAL BUGS@{ub}

* SG doesn't read through PIPE:.

* ProRunner II preprocessed gives false hit inside SG's code. A deeper
check on this format could easily be made.

* A small pause will occur when SG receives too long command lines. Not
much to do about it. (This pause _might_ seem pretty long on 68000s...)
:(

* Running Mungwall or other debugging utilities which fills
memoryallocations when issuing HUNT without an address will cause the
largest free memory-block to be overwritten.

* If you give SGs input as a file, YOU must be sure that no command
lines exceeds 160 bytes. If they do, the rest of the file will be
skipped.

* When run on displays not capable of displaying 76 coloumns
side-by-side, SGs output will look terrible. (Atleast mod-info!) This is
ofcourse not my fault. Try changing font or resolution.

* The Control-C checking often retrig after a break. (?) I _think_ I
know how to fix.

* The Phenomena Packer search-routine is a bit trigger happy. I'll
fix... (Well, some day anyway...)

* It is possible to have two files in the file-list with the same name.
When flushing, the first file is flushed. (Not really bug?)

* The flush command tells me that I saved 264 bytes, even though no
system- resources was removed. Hmm... Dunno the reason... (By further
investigation, it seems that this only happens when my startup-sequence
has been run!?!)

* The argument parser gets tricky sometimes, and won't accept any input
at all. (Not even command name!) Unfortunately, this happens so seldom,
it's rather difficult for me to figure out the reason. (Haven't happened
for a while. Bug accidentally removed? 8)

* "SG >AUX: <AUX:" causes some input problems. Use "SG nostdio iostream
AUX:" for permanent workaround. I'm not sure if this problem occurs on
all re- directed I/O to SG.



@{b}MODULEFORMATS BUGS & NOTES@{ub}

* UNIC/Laxity-tracker modules are faulty recognised as 31 Instrument
Tracker modules. If any modules ripped as such with SG seems unusable in
ProTracker, try converting them...

* Some UNIC/Laxity-tracker modules gets 4 bytes too much in length. No
real problems should occur though.

* The length of Phenomena Packer modules is often calculated as up to
1024 bytes too long. No problems should occur though.

* ProRunner I and Wanton Packer modules with their ID removed will be
recognised as 31 Instrument Tracker modules.

* The QuadraComposer positions and highest pattern info doesn't work.
(Won't be fixed in the nearest future...)

* Some ProTracker modules converted from module-formats with a
stretchable number of instruments (Quadracomposer and NoisePacker) will
not be found. This is because the replens of the unused instruments are
set to 0. The correct value should be 1. (This might also be true for
some modules converted from 15-instrument to 31-instrument tracker!)
Trying to work around this would cause a lot of false alarms when
hunting.

@{b}FUTURE FEATURES@{ub}

These appear in approximated order of importance:

* Rip ThePlayer modules.

* Make support for ExoticBoot and CS memory buffers. 8)

* Improve FDISK with progressreport and abort possibilities.

* Attempt to close the output-window given by Workbench.

* If a hunt within a file is broken and continue is requested, SG really
shouldn't search through rest of mem.

* Write documentation as AmigaGuide®.

* Implement my extract-command as a part of SG.

* Let FDISK read one sector at a time to make abort possible.

* Improve trackdisk errorreports.

* Dump code.

* Make filelist flexible enough to handle segmented objects.

* Add decrunching of RNC version 2 executable crunched files.

* Add READOBJ.

* Execute DOS commands. (Or a shell?)

* Rewrite the piece of code that finds the largest memorychunk for
searching through chipmem.

* Let FLIST accept a file as argument to list one file only.

* Read icon tooltypes for arguments.

* Play memory as sample.

* TYPE.

* HELP to invoke AmigaGuide®.

* MC command to clear all free memory.

* Add posibility to redirect output to a disk file.

* HDEC which only searches memory and lists found crunched files and DEC
command to decrunch.

* Fix input reading to allow scripts to be defined.

* Allow READBIN to find suitable memory locations.

* Allow hexadecimal numbers to be specified as 0x????????.

* Checksum on found module, to prevent damaged modules to be saved. (Not
really useful any longer, since found modules are allocated!)

* DELETE

* RENAME

* Fill memory.

* Copy memory.

* Read tracks to address.

* Jump to adress.

* REJECT command to reject found modules. (Why?)

* Distribute MemSaver for ripping of modules at low locations.

* Possibility to turn off multitasking while searching to gain speed.

* Analyze executables crunched with unknown crunchers (like in
NoiseHunter).

* "Remove incomplete file?" at write error.

* Scan memory for crunched files.

* Detach if SG received CLIARG "DETACH" from CLI/SHELL. (In that case,
CLIARG "NOSTDIO" will automatically be activated.) What next? A
commodity port?!?

* Reinsert ProTracker play-routine. (Do I have to?!)
